; Implementation of adding 1 to any binary number.
; By default the most left position considered as low bit.

; For initial state first perform transition to low bit with
; m_right state

; m_right doesn't change bit state, just shifts current position
; right till blank space is found

; If there is empty string the code is stoped

; add_0 state doesn't change current bit state, just moves position left
; add_1 state change current bit state to opposite (0->1, 1->0), and moves
; position left

; halt condition is blank space in most left position is found
